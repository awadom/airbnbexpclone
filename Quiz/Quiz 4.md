1. What does the `.map()` array method do?
   my answer: the .map() array method takes an array and maps the values to a new array, this allows you to modify each element and create a new array to use.

exempler:returns a new array and whatever gets returned from the call back function provided is placed at the same index in the new array. usually we take the items from the otiginal array and modify them in some way.

2. What do we usually use `.map()` for in React?
   my answer: mapping props to a component.
   exempler:convert an arry of raw data into an array of jsx elements that can be displayed on the page.

3. Why is using `.map()` better than just creating the components
   manually by typing them out?
   my answer:
   it takes less time usually and you would usually be getting data from an api and not having it typed out.
   exempler: it makes our code more self sustaining - not requiring additional changes whenever the data changes.
